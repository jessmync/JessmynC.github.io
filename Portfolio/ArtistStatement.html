			<p id="p1"> Firstly, thanks for stopping by! </p>

			<p id="p2"> I'm Jessmyn. I'm a studio artist and landscape photographer based in the Bay Area, with an emphasis on combining simple pen + paper, and illustrations crafted digitally. I have always been highly detail-oriented and grapheme-color synesthetic, which have allowed me to connect my thoughts better, put intention into every aspect of my work, and enhance the overall experience of each piece. </p> 

			<p id="p3"> As a college student in a big, fast paced city, I am surrounded by thousands of moving images everyday, thus transforming me into an observer with a childlike curiosity, drowning in the endless 'what if's'. Being an artist has given me an opportunity and creative outlet to address these situations, and hopefully reach and inspire a larger community. </p>

			<p id="p4"> I aspire to challenge myself by working unconventionally and combining drastically different mediums. Most importantly, I hope that my work tells stories and influences others to create dialogue, discussion, and disagreement. </p>
