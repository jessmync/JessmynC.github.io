			<p id="p2"> 20. So-called "INFJ". Ambivert. </p>

			<p id="p3"> These are the labels that society categorizes us into based on its set of standards, commonalities, and the opinions of everyone around us. I guess that since I can't see myself fitting into any of these, I don't belong in society. I don't identify as '20' since I'm a kid at heart. According to the MBTI, I'm introverted, intuitive, feeling, and judgement. But according to myself, I'm an ambivert (introvert + extrovert). Everyone possesses a different amount (%) of each trait, so it's unfair to generalize everyone into one type. It's as if we're 100% of each quality that we are supposedly identified as. </p>

			<p id="p4"> But I'm also more than this. We all are. We're not just statistics to be thrown around. We're all unique and just trying to get through this crazy thing called "life". We all have stories and here's mine. </p>

			<p id="p5"> I'm currently a fifth term, third year student at San Jose State University with a major in studio art. I'm blessed to be a Bay Area native, being surrounded by so many resources and people with such good work ethics. I'm still a work in progress as well as my artistic style and stylistic choices. My art direction is still undecided but I'm always experimenting with new mediums that challenge me both physically and mentally. </p> 

			<p id="p6"> On the side, some of my hobbies include singing accoustic covers, lifting heavy, and photographing parts of my life. I hope that I can inspire others not only with my art, but also through this versaitility, to take risks, get out of their comfort zone, and try new activities. </p>

			<p id="p6"> Remember to be a nobody than a somebody since noobdy's perfect. Be different and be a visionary. </p>
